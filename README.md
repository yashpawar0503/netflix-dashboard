# Netflix Data Dashboard
This is my first hands-on data analysis project where I explored Netflix’s content using an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

The goal was simple:
Learn by doing, visualize real data, and build something I can share with others.

# What This Project Does
It takes the Netflix content dataset (from Kaggle) and turns it into a clean, filterable dashboard where you can:

Explore how many titles were added each year
Compare movies and TV shows
See which countries and genres dominate the platform
Filter content by year, type, or even search for a title
Download the filtered results as a CSV

All presented with a dark, Netflix-style theme.

# How to Run It
If you want to try this locally:

Clone the repo
Install the required Python libraries
Run the app using Streamlit

# What I Learned
As someone just starting out in data analytics, this project helped me understand:

The basics of data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas
How to use Streamlit to make interactive dashboards
Creating plots using Plotly and Matplotlib
Making data projects more visual and beginner-friendly

# Dataset Used
Netflix Titles dataset from Kaggle.
You can upload the CSV file directly in the app.
